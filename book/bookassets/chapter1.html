    <h2><u>Chapter 1</u></h2>
    <h2><u><strong>Don't Try</strong></u></h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Charles Bukowski was an alcoholic, a womanizer, a chronic gambler, a lout, a
        cheapskate, a deadbeat, and on his
        worst days, a poet. He's probably the last person on earth you would ever look to for life advice or expect to
        see in any sort of self-help book. <br> <br>
        Which is why he's the perfect place to start. <br> <br>
        Bukowski wanted to be a writer. But for decades his work was rejected by almost every magazine, newspaper,
        journal, agent, and publisher he submitted to. His work was horrible, they said. Crude. Disgusting. Depraved.
        And as the stacks of rejection slips piled up, the weight of his failures pushed him deep into an alcohol-fueled
        depression that would follow him for most of his life. <br> <br>
        Bukowski had a day job as a letter-filer at a post office. He got paid shit money and spent most of it on booze.
        He gambled away the rest at the racetrack. At night, he would drink alone and sometimes hammer out poetry on his
        beat-up old typewriter. Often, he'd wake up on the floor, having passed out the night before.
        Thirty years went by like this, most of it a meaningless blur of alcohol, drugs, gambling, and prostitutes.
        Then, when Bukowski was fifty, after a lifetime of failure and self-loathing, an editor at a small independent
        publishing house took a strange interest in him. The editor couldn't offer Bukowski much money or much promise
        of sales. But he had a weird affection for the drunk loser, so he decided to take a chance on him. It was the
        first real shot Bukowski had ever gotten, and, he
        realized, probably the only one he would ever get. Bukowski wrote back to the editor: "I have one of two
        choices-stay in the post office and go crazy ... or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided
        to starve." <br> <br>
        Upon signing the contract, Bukowski wrote his first novel in three weeks. It was called simply Post Office. In
        the dedication, he wrote, “Dedicated to nobody.” <br> <br>
        Bukowski would make it as a novelist and poet. He would go on and publish six novels and hundreds of poems,
        selling over two million copies of his books. His popularity defied everyone's expectations, particularly his
        own. <br>
        Stories like Bukowski's are the bread and butter of our cultural narrative. Bukowski's life embodies the
        American Dream: a man fights for what he wants, never gives up, and eventually achieves his wildest dreams. It's
        practically a movie waiting to happen. We all look at stories like Bukowski's and say, “See? He never gave up.
        He never stopped trying. He always believed in himself. He persisted against all the odds and made something of
        himself!” <br><br>
        It is then strange that on Bukowski's tombstone, the epitaph reads: “Don't try.” <br> <br>
        See, despite the book sales and the fame, Bukowski was a loser. He knew it. And his success stemmed not from
        some determination to be a winner, but from the fact that he knew he was a loser, accepted it, and then wrote
        honestly about it. He never tried to be anything other than what he was. The genius in Bukowski's work was not
        in overcoming unbelievable odds or developing himself into a shining literary light. It was the opposite. It was
        his simple ability to be completely, unflinchingly honest with himself-especially the worst parts of himself—and
        to share his failings without hesitation or doubt. <br>
        This is the real story of Bukowski's success: his comfort with himself as a failure. Bukowski didn't give a fuck
        about success. Even after his fame, he still showed up to poetry readings hammered and verbally abused people in
        his audience. He still exposed himself in public and tried to sleep with every woman he could find. Fame and
        success didn't make him a better person. Nor was it by becoming a better person that he became famous and
        successful. <br><br>
        Self-improvement and success often occur together. But that doesn't necessarily mean they're the same thing.
        Our culture today is obsessively focused on unrealistically positive expectations: Be happier. Be healthier. Be
        the best, better than the rest. Be smarter, faster, richer, sexier, more popular, more productive, more envied,
        and more admired. Be perfect and amazing and crap out twelve-karat-gold nuggets before breakfast each morning
        while kissing your selfie-ready spouse and two and a half kids goodbye. Then fly your helicopter to your
        wonderfully fulfilling job, where you spend your days doing incredibly meaningful work that's likely to save the
        planet one day. <br><br>
        But when you stop and really think about it, conventional life advice-all the positive and happy self-help stuff
        we hear all the time-is actually fixating on what you lack. It lasers in on what you perceive your personal
        shortcomings and failures to already be, and then emphasizes them for you. You learn about the best ways to make
        money because you feel you don't have enough money already. You stand in front of the mirror and repeat
        affirmations saying that you're beautiful because you feel as though you're not beautiful already. You follow
        dating and relationship advice because you feel that you're unlovable already. You try goofy
        visualization exercises about being more successful because you feel as though you aren't successful enough
        already. <br><br>
        Ironically, this fixation on the positive-on what's better, what's superior-only serves to remind us over and
        over again of what we are not, of what we lack, of what we should have been but failed to be. After all, no
        truly happy person feels the need to stand in front of a mirror and recite that she's happy. She just is. <br>
        There's a saying in Texas: “The smallest dog barks the loudest." A confident man doesn't feel a need to prove
        that he's confident. A rich woman doesn't feel a need to convince anybody that she's rich. Either you are or you
        are not. And if you're dreaming of something all the time, then you're reinforcing the same unconscious reality
        over and over: that you are not that. <br>
        Everyone and their TV commercial wants you to believe that the key to a good life is a nicer job, or a more
        rugged car, or a prettier girlfriend, or a hot tub with an inflatable pool for the kids. The world is constantly
        telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more-buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be
        more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time. Give a fuck
        about a new TV. Give a fuck about having a better vacation than your coworkers. Give a fuck about buying that
        new lawn ornament. Give a fuck about having the right kind of selfie stick. <br>
        Why? My guess: because giving a fuck about more stuff is good for business. <br> <br>
        And while there's nothing wrong with good business, the
        problem is that giving too many fucks is bad for your mental
        health. It causes you to become overly attached to the superficial
        and fake, to dedicate your life to chasing a mirage of happiness
        and satisfaction. The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about
        more; it's giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what
        is true and immediate and important. <br><br>

        <span id="hell"><b><u>The Feedback Loop from Hell</u></b></span> <br><br>
        There's an insidious quirk to your brain that, if you let it, can drive you absolutely batty. Tell me if this
        sounds familiar to you: <br>
        You get anxious about confronting somebody in your life. That anxiety cripples you and you start wondering why
        you're so anxious. Now you're becoming anxious about being anxious. Oh no! Doubly anxious! Now you're anxious
        about your anxiety, which is causing more anxiety. Quick, where's the whiskey? <br><br>
        Or let's say you have an anger problem. You get pissed off at
        the stupidest, most inane stuff, and you have no idea why. And
        the fact that you get pissed off so easily starts to piss you off even
        more. And then, in your petty rage, you realize that being angry
        all the time makes you a shallow and mean person, and you hate
        this; you hate it so much that you get angry at yourself. Now look
        at you: you're angry at yourself getting angry about being angry.
        Fuck you, wall. Here, have a fist. <br>
        Or you're so worried about doing the right thing all the time that you become worried about how much you're
        worrying. Or you feel so guilty for every mistake you make that you begin to feel guilty about how guilty you're
        feeling. Or you get sad and alone so often that it makes you feel even more sad and alone just thinking about
        it. <br>
        Welcome to the Feedback Loop from Hell. Chances are you've engaged in it more than a few times. Maybe you're
        engaging in it right now: "God, I do the Feedback Loop all the time-I'm such a loser for doing it. I should
        stop. Oh my God, I feel like such a loser for calling myself a loser. I should stop calling myself a loser. Ah,
        fuck! I'm doing it again! See? I'm a loser! Argh!"
        Calm down, amigo. Believe it or not, this is part of the beauty of being human. Very few animals on earth have
        the ability to think cogent thoughts to begin with, but we humans have the luxury of being able to have thoughts
        about our thoughts. So I can
