    <h2 id="desire">The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of
        one's negative experience is itself a positive experience.</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        This is a total mind-fuck. So I'll give you a minute to unpretzel your brain and maybe read that again: Wanting
        positive experience is a negative experience; accepting negative experience is a positive experience. It's what
        the philosopher Alan Watts used to refer to as “the backwards law"-the idea that the more you pursue feeling
        better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing something only reinforces the fact that you lack
        it in the first place. The more you desperately want to be rich, the more poor and unworthy you feel, regardless
        of how much money you actually make. <br>
        The more you desperately want to be sexy and desired, the uglier you come
        to see yourself, regardless of your actual physical appearance. The more you desperately want to be happy and
        loved, the lonelier and more afraid you become, regardless of those who surround you. The more you want to be
        spiritually enlightened, the more self-centered and shallow you become in trying to get there. <br><br>
        It's like this one time I tripped on acid and it felt like the
        more I walked toward a house, the farther away the house got
        from me. And yes, I just used my LSD hallucinations to make a
        philosophical point about happiness. No fucks given. <br><br>
       <span id="summary"> As the existential philosopher Albert Camus said (and I'm pretty sure he wasn't on LSD at the time): "You will
        never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking
        for the meaning of life.” Or put more simply: <br>
        Don't try.
